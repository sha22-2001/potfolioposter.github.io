            <h2>Think</h2>
            <h3>"Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right."</h3>
            <p> In todayâ€™s world, most humans think about technological development but fail to see the destruction they cause.
                So thinking this I made this poster which shows thinking is not a bad idea but thinking 
                for both nature and technology is the best idea.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <h3>"Hold the vision trust the process"</h3>
            <p> I did this poster in photoshop keeping in mind the vision of getting success.
                Most people get diverted from their goals as they walk.
                So your focus should be particularly in one thing and you can have thousand of ways to reach your goal </p>

            <h2>Time</h2>
            <h3>"Lost time is never found again."</h3>
            <p> Time is one of the important things in one's life. Keeping this in mind I made a poster which 
                shows if you do not work on time, you will be in the midst of a forest and could not able to see the path of
                 success but if you give value to time then in that mist you are going to see the bright light which
                  shows you the path of success     </p>

            <h2>Ocean</h2>
            <h3>"Our heart is like the ocean, mysterious and dark."</h3>
            <p> I made this poster keeping in mind that The ocean is considered to be boundless, a place where one 
                can easily be lost, and can therefore be 
                seen to represent the boundless span of life, and the way one can get lost on the journey through life. </p>
